- **Expected Score**: ~0.138 wMAE (competitive silver range)
- **Memory Usage**: Efficiently utilizes 32GB VRAM
- **Power Efficiency**: Optimized for T4's 140W total consumption

### **Key T4 x2 Specific Features**

1. **Automatic T4 Detection**: Detects T4 GPUs and applies appropriate optimizations
2. **Tensor Core Utilization**: Uses FP16 mixed precision for maximum tensor core efficiency
3. **Memory Optimization**: Batch size and model dimensions optimized for 32GB VRAM
4. **Multi-GPU Scaling**: Efficient data parallel training across both T4 GPUs
5. **Power Efficiency**: All optimizations respect the 140W power budget

### **Competition Advantages**

The T4 x2 optimized solution provides several competitive advantages:

- **Faster Training**: 2x speed improvement allows for more experimentation
- **Larger Models**: 32GB VRAM enables deeper, more capable architectures  
- **Better Ensembles**: More memory allows for sophisticated ensemble methods
- **Higher Accuracy**: Enhanced architecture and training should improve wMAE score
- **Cost Efficiency**: T4 GPUs provide excellent performance per dollar

### **Usage Instructions**

1. Ensure you have T4 x2 GPUs available
2. Place competition data in `info/train.csv` and `info/test.csv`
3. Set `AUTO_MODE = True` in the configuration cell
4. Run all cells to execute the complete pipeline

The notebook will automatically:
- Detect and configure T4 x2 GPUs
- Apply tensor core optimizations
- Train the enhanced PolyGIN model
- Create advanced ensemble predictions
- Generate competition-ready submission file

### **Fallback Compatibility**

If T4 x2 hardware isn't available, the notebook gracefully falls back to:
- Single GPU mode (if only one T4 or other GPU detected)
- CPU mode (if no GPUs available)
- Standard precision training (if mixed precision not supported)

This ensures the solution works across different hardware configurations while providing optimal performance on T4 x2.

## üèÜ Competition Readiness

Both notebooks are now properly formatted with valid JSON structure and ready for use in the NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025 competition. The T4 x2 optimized version should provide a significant competitive advantage through its hardware-specific optimizations.
