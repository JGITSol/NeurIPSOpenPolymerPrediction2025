Analysis of NeurIPS 2025 Polymer Prediction Notebook Issues
Based on a detailed examination of the provided notebooks and research into common PyTorch and Kaggle notebook issues, I've identified the key problems preventing these notebooks from working properly in both auto-run and manual execution modes.

Critical Issues with T4X2 Notebook
The T4X2 notebook contains several fundamental problems that cause it to hang:

Package Installation Problems
The notebook uses subprocess.check_call for package installation, which is notorious for hanging indefinitely without proper timeout mechanisms. The custom install_package function can freeze if pip encounters any issues during installation, particularly in Kaggle's containerized environment.

DataLoader Configuration Issues
The notebook configures DataLoaders with num_workers=2, which is a common source of freezing in Jupyter/Kaggle environments. Research shows that PyTorch DataLoader with num_workers > 0 frequently hangs on Windows systems and in notebook environments due to multiprocessing limitations.

Resource Conflicts
The combination of DataParallel, mixed precision training, and multi-worker data loading creates complex resource conflicts. The notebook enables multiple GPU features simultaneously, which can lead to deadlocks when workers compete for resources.

Single Cell Execution
The entire solution is crammed into one massive cell, making debugging impossible and increasing the likelihood of hanging at any point in the execution chain.

Critical Issues with CPU Notebook
The CPU notebook has even more severe structural problems:

Kernel Termination
The second cell contains os._exit(0), which immediately terminates the kernel after package installation. This prevents any subsequent cells from executing, making the notebook completely non-functional in auto-run mode.

Excessive Training Configuration
The notebook sets NUM_EPOCHS = 100 for CPU training, which would exceed Kaggle's 12-hour execution limit. Without proper early stopping, this guarantees timeout failure.

Incomplete Code
Critical sections contain ellipsis (...) indicating incomplete implementation, particularly in the data processing functions.

Path Inconsistencies
The notebook uses different data path formats compared to the T4X2 version, causing FileNotFoundError exceptions.

Why T4X2 Hangs with Minimal Resource Usage
The T4X2 notebook exhibits the classic symptoms of a DataLoader deadlock:

Worker Process Deadlock: DataLoader spawns worker processes that get stuck waiting for data or synchronization signals

Package Installation Hang: The subprocess call for pip installation waits indefinitely for a response that never comes

GPU Memory Allocation: Mixed precision and DataParallel features may be waiting for GPU memory allocation or synchronization

The minimal resource usage occurs because the main process is idle, waiting for worker processes or subprocesses that are themselves blocked.

Auto-Run vs Manual Execution Differences
Research reveals several key differences between Kaggle's auto-run and manual execution modes:

Resource Management
Auto-run has stricter timeout enforcement and resource allocation policies, making it less tolerant of hanging operations.

Environment Initialization
Package installation and multiprocessing behave differently in auto-run environments, with more restrictive security and process spawning policies.

Error Handling
Manual execution allows cell-by-cell debugging and recovery, while auto-run requires complete success from start to finish.

Solutions and Recommendations
To fix these notebooks:

Remove Dynamic Package Installation: Use Kaggle's built-in packages or install requirements through the environment settings

Set num_workers=0: Eliminate multiprocessing issues by using single-threaded data loading

Add Proper Error Handling: Implement timeout mechanisms and graceful error recovery

Reduce Training Epochs: Use realistic epoch counts with early stopping

Split Large Cells: Break complex operations into smaller, debuggable units

Fix Incomplete Code: Complete all ellipsis sections with proper implementations

The fundamental issue is that both notebooks attempt complex multiprocessing operations in an environment (Kaggle notebooks) that has known limitations with worker processes and subprocess management. The T4X2 version's hanging with minimal resource usage is a textbook case of DataLoader worker deadlock, exacerbated by unnecessary complexity in package installation and GPU resource management.
