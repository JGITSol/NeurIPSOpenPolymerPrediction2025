# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves fixing critical errors in the polymer prediction pipeline and improving the codebase by integrating existing production-ready components from the repository. The main issues include DataLoader compatibility problems, missing imports, incomplete implementations, and lack of proper testing. The goal is to create a robust, tested, and production-ready polymer prediction system that leverages the existing well-structured codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical Runtime Errors

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the polymer prediction pipeline to run without errors, so that I can train models and generate predictions successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main pipeline is executed THEN the system SHALL use PyTorch Geometric's DataLoader instead of regular PyTorch DataLoader for graph data
2. WHEN processing molecular graphs THEN the system SHALL properly import torch_geometric.data module to avoid NameError
3. WHEN training the GCN model THEN the system SHALL handle batch processing correctly without collation errors
4. WHEN the pipeline encounters invalid SMILES strings THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN running the complete pipeline THEN all required dependencies SHALL be properly imported and available

### Requirement 2: Integrate Existing Production Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage the existing well-tested components in the repository, so that I don't duplicate functionality and maintain code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the dataset functionality THEN the system SHALL use the existing PolymerDataset class from src/polymer_prediction/data/dataset.py
2. WHEN implementing training functionality THEN the system SHALL use the existing trainer utilities from src/polymer_prediction/training/trainer.py
3. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL use the existing metrics utilities from src/polymer_prediction/utils/metrics.py
4. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL use the existing validation utilities from src/polymer_prediction/data/validation.py
5. WHEN processing molecular features THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing featurization modules if available

### Requirement 3: Complete Missing Implementations

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want all model components to be fully implemented, so that I can train and evaluate complete ensemble models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training tree ensemble models THEN the system SHALL provide complete implementations for LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models
2. WHEN performing hyperparameter optimization THEN the system SHALL implement complete Optuna optimization for all model types
3. WHEN creating stacking ensembles THEN the system SHALL implement proper cross-validation and meta-learning functionality
4. WHEN generating final predictions THEN the system SHALL properly combine GCN and tree ensemble predictions
5. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL create properly formatted submission files

### Requirement 4: Implement Comprehensive Testing

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want comprehensive tests for all components, so that I can ensure code reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the main pipeline THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all major components
2. WHEN testing data processing THEN the system SHALL include tests for SMILES validation, feature extraction, and dataset creation
3. WHEN testing model training THEN the system SHALL include tests for GCN training, tree ensemble training, and ensemble combination
4. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL include tests for invalid inputs and edge cases
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve reasonable code coverage and pass all test cases

### Requirement 5: Improve Code Structure and Configuration

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clean, well-structured code with proper configuration management, so that the system is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into appropriate modules (data, models, training, utils)
2. WHEN managing configuration THEN the system SHALL use a centralized configuration system compatible with the existing project structure
3. WHEN handling file paths THEN the system SHALL use proper path management that works across different environments
4. WHEN logging information THEN the system SHALL use structured logging compatible with the existing logging utilities
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure all required packages are properly specified and compatible

### Requirement 6: Enhance Error Handling and Robustness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback, so that I can understand and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering invalid SMILES THEN the system SHALL log warnings and continue processing with valid molecules
2. WHEN facing memory constraints THEN the system SHALL implement proper memory management and garbage collection
3. WHEN dealing with missing data THEN the system SHALL handle sparse targets correctly using existing masked loss implementations
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with actionable information
5. WHEN running on different hardware THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and adapt to available resources (CPU/GPU)

### Requirement 7: Optimize Performance and Resource Usage

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to run efficiently on available hardware, so that I can train models in reasonable time with limited resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training on CPU THEN the system SHALL use CPU-optimized configurations and batch sizes
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data loading with proper caching
3. WHEN training multiple models THEN the system SHALL implement proper memory cleanup between model training sessions
4. WHEN using ensemble methods THEN the system SHALL optimize cross-validation to balance accuracy and computational cost
5. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL batch process test data efficiently
