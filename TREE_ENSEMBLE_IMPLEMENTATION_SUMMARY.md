# Tree Ensemble Models Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete tree ensemble models for polymer property prediction as specified in task 3 of the polymer-prediction-improvement spec.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Individual Model Wrappers
- **LightGBMWrapper**: Complete scikit-learn compatible wrapper for LightGBM
- **XGBoostWrapper**: Complete scikit-learn compatible wrapper for XGBoost  
- **CatBoostWrapper**: Complete scikit-learn compatible wrapper for CatBoost with categorical feature support

### 2. Hyperparameter Optimization
- **HyperparameterOptimizer**: Optuna-based optimization for all three model types
- Proper objective functions with cross-validation
- Support for multi-target regression with missing values
- Configurable number of trials and CV folds

### 3. Ensemble Training Pipeline

- Proper error messages and warnings
- Fallback mechanisms for failed model training

### Performance Optimization
- Cross-validation based model weighting
- Efficient hyperparameter search spaces
- Memory-efficient training with proper cleanup

### Integration
- Full integration with existing project structure
- Compatible with existing data processing pipeline
- Proper logging and progress reporting
